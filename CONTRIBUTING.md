# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for your interest in the **Functional Conformance Assessment Framework (FCAF)**.

This document describes the current contribution policy for this repository.
Please note that the FCAF is **work in progress** and currently in an **initial bootstrap phase (v0.0.1)**.

---

## ⚠️ Current status (important)

- This repository currently contains **initial, non-final content** intended to:
  - establish structure,
  - provide high-level orientation,
  - support early coordination and alignment.
- **Issue tracking and pull requests are not yet enabled.**
- External contributions (issues and pull requests) will be enabled **once version 0.1.0 is published**.

Until then, the content should be treated as **informative and provisional**.

---

## 1) Purpose & scope

This repository hosts documentation and artefacts for the **Functional Conformance Assessment Framework (FCAF)**.

The FCAF is intended to:

- support and harmonise functional conformance testing under the applicable **Implementing Regulations**,
- improve **interoperability** across EUDI Wallet implementations,
- provide reusable artefacts (test specifications, test books, data definitions, and guidance)
  for use by **Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs)** and related stakeholders.

At this stage, the content is **not normative** and does not replace, amend, or reinterpret
any legally binding text.

> Normative requirements remain exclusively defined by the applicable Implementing
> Regulations and referenced legal acts.

---

## 2) Contribution model (from v0.1.0 onwards)

Once version **v0.1.0** is reached, this repository is expected to adopt an **open contribution model**.

Planned contribution mechanisms include:

- GitHub issues for:
  - content clarifications,
  - editorial improvements,
  - error corrections,
  - technical questions and alignment discussions.
- Pull requests for:
  - proposed text changes,
  - additional explanatory material,
  - improvements.

Detailed contribution instructions, issue templates, and review processes will be
published as part of the **v0.1.0** release.

In addition, following each major FCAF release (including **v0.1.0**), the FCAF will be presented during focus meetings
on certification to gather feedback that will inform subsequent releases.

As the FCAF aims to provide a high level of rigor in assessing existing functional requirements mandated by the Regulation,
it will continue to evolve through iterative releases until a sufficient level of maturity is achieved.

Prior to the publication of each major FCAF release after **v1.0.0**, the consolidated changelog and the potential impact of
included changes on previously completed conformity assessments will be reviewed.
Before breaking changes or substantive changes are envisaged, these changes will be presented to Member States for
discussion and feedback before their inclusion in a major release.
Breaking changes after the **v1.0.0** release are not anticipated. 
This approach supports transparent consideration of substantive changes and, where relevant, the identification
of appropriate transition or coexistence measures.

## 3) Code of conduct

All interactions in this repository are expected to be:

- respectful,
- constructive,
- focused on technical and editorial substance.

Disagreement is normal; personal remarks are not.
Concrete proposals, references, and examples are strongly encouraged.

---

## 4) Editorial principles (preview)

The following editorial principles are expected to apply once contributions are enabled:

- Contributions should **improve clarity, traceability, implementability, and interoperability**.
- Contributions must not alter the **scope or intent** of the applicable Implementing Regulations.
- Use **RFC 2119 / RFC 8174 keywords** (MUST, SHALL, SHOULD, MAY) **only** when:
  - quoting normative text, or
  - precisely tracking regulatory language.
- Otherwise, use plain, descriptive language.

These principles are aligned with related EUDI documentation (e.g. the Architecture and Reference Framework).

---

## 5) Versioning & change management

The FCAF follows a maturity-based versioning approach:

- **v0.0.x** — Bootstrap phase (structure, orientation, initial content)
- **v0.1.0** — MVP version, enabling CAB preparation and pilot assessments
- **v1.0.0** — First version meeting all mandatory functional requirements under the
  applicable Implementing Regulations, suitable for regulatory use

> Version numbers reflect **artefact maturity**, not immutability of the legal framework.
> Future regulatory changes may require subsequent minor or major versions.

A concise change log will accompany releases. Detailed editorial history remains
available via Git history.

## 6) Licensing & IPR

All content in this repository is subject to the repository [LICENSE](LICENSE.md).

By contributing once contributions are enabled, you confirm that:

- you have the right to contribute the content,
- your contribution may be reused under the terms of the license,
- no incompatible third-party material is introduced without clear attribution.

---

## 7) Contact

Until issue tracking is enabled, the repository is maintained through coordinated
working arrangements.

Questions about scope or process should be raised via the established coordination
channels associated with the FCAF work.

## What happens next

- **v0.0.x** — Bootstrap phase (structure, orientation, initial content)
- **v0.1.0** — Issue tracking and contribution workflow enabled
- **≥ v0.1.0** — Iterative refinement with stakeholder input

Indicative milestones and evolution of the framework are described in
[roadmap.md](docs/overview/roadmap.md).

Thank you for your interest and patience while the framework is being established.
