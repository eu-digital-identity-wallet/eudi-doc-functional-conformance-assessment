## Profile applicability


## EUDI-wallet relevancy
EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions


## Test Scenario
1. The wallet engages with verifier
2. The verifier sends an Authorization request including a transaction_data object that contains credential_ids for a specific credential the wallet does not have
3. Wallet processes request and the transaction_data structure
4. Test the response returned by the wallet to the verifier

## Expected results
1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated
2. Wallet receives request
3. Wallet identifies that it does not hold credentials of credential_ids in transaction_data object
4. Verify the wallet does NOT proceed to the user consent screen, instead it must return an error response: invalid_transaction_data
