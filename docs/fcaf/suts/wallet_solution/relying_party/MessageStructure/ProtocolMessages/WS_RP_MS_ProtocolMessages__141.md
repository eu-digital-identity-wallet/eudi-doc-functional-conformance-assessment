## EUDI-wallet relevancy

## Preconditions


## Test Scenario
1. The wallet engages with the verifier.
2. The verifier sends an Authorization request that includes both a valid dcql_query object & a scope value intended to trigger a DCQL based credential request
3. Wallet processes the request and identifies the conflicting parameters.
4. Test the response returned by the wallet to the Verifier.

## Expected results
1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated
2. Wallet receives request
3. True: The Wallet does NOT proceed to credential selection or user authorization.
4. Verify: The Wallet returns an error response where the error parameter is exactly invalid_request.
