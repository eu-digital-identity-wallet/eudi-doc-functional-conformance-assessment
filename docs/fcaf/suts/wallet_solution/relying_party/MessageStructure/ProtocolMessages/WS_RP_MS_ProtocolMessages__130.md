## References

## Profile applicability


## EUDI-wallet relevancy
EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions


## Test Scenario
1. The wallet engages with the verifier
2. The verifier sends an Authorization request to the wallet, with response mode=direct_post.jwt, and a client_metadata object containing a enc parameter
3. Wallet processes request

## Expected results
1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated
2. Wallet receives request
3. Verify the wallet returns a response, without an error, and that it uses that enc value in the verifier metadata to perform its encryption
