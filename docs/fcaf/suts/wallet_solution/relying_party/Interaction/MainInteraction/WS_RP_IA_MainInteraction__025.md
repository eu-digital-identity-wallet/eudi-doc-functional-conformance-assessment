## Test Scenario
Verifier sends a claim_set requiring 3 claims, but the Wallet only has 2 of them, it MUST NOT return that set. It must move to the next option in the array.

## Expected results
The Wallet only has 2 of them, so it MUST NOT return that set. It must move to the next option in the array. The response should reflect this.
