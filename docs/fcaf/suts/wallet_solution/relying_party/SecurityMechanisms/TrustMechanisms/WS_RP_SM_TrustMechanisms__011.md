## References
[OID4VP 6.1.1]

## Profile applicability

## EUDI-wallet relevancy
EUDI_generic | EUDI_optional

## Preconditions
Scenario when the Trusted List signature is invalid or if the URL in the query is unreachable.

## Test Scenario
1. The Wallet engages with the Verifier
2. Verifier sends a DCQL query requesting a credential with a "trusted_authorities" property with its type being "etsi_tl".
3. The Wallet evaluates the request.

## Expected results
1. Wallet and Verifier can interact.
2. Wallet receives the request.
3a. The Wallet checks the issuer of its stored credential against the entries in the Trusted List.
3b. It confirms the Issuer's status according to the list's metadata.
3c. The wallet will not use the credential and returns an error if the Trusted List signature is invalid or if the URL in the query is unreachable.
3d. Wallet will make sure it only returns privacy-safe error response to verifier.
