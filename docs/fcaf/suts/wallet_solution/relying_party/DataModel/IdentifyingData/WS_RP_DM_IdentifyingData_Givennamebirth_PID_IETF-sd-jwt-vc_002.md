## Preconditions
A. A presentation request was sent to the EUDI wallet, to retrieve a PID Credential in IETF SD-JWT VC format.  
B. All mandatory data elements within namespace "urn:eudi:pid:" and all data elements indicated as present in the ICS were requested. 
C. EUDI wallet presented the Credential successfully. 
D. The presence of claim `birth_given_name` in the IETF SD-JWT VC Credential presented was verified.

## Test Scenario
1. Verify that the claim `birth_given_name` is a String encoded in UTF-8, supporting the full Unicode range.

## Expected results
