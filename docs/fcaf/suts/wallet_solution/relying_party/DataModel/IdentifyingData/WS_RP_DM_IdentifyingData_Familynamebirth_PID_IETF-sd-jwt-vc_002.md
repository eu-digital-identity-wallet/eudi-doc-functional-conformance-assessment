## Profile applicability
The EUDI wallet contains a Credential in SD-JWT VC format with vct = "urn:eudi:pid:". The claim `birth_family_name` is included in a person identification data.

## Preconditions
A. A presentation request was sent to the EUDI wallet, to retrieve a PID Credential in IETF SD-JWT VC format.  
B. All mandatory data elements within namespace "urn:eudi:pid:" and all data elements indicated as present in the ICS were requested. 
C. EUDI wallet presented the Credential successfully. 
D. The presence of claim `birth_family_name` in the IETF SD-JWT VC Credential presented was verified.

## Test Scenario
1. Verify that the claim family_name is a String encoded in UTF-8, supporting the full Unicode range.

## Expected results
1. The claim `birth_family_name` is a String encoded in UTF-8, supporting the full Unicode range.
