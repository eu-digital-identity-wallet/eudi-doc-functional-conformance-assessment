## Profile applicability
The EUDI wallet contains a Credential in ISO-mdoc format with DocType = “eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1”

## Preconditions
A. A device retrieval mdoc request was sent to the EUDI wallet, to retrieve the document with DocType = "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1". 
B. All mandatory data elements within nameSpace "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1" and all data elements indicated as present in the ICS were requested. 
C. The device retrieval mdoc response was retrieved. 
D. The presence of data element portrait in the device retrieval mdoc response was verified.

## Test Scenario
1. Verify the first two bytes of the CBOR byte string. 2. Verify that the encoded image format corresponds to the value of the first two bytes.

## Expected results
1. The first two bytes are equal to 'FF D8'. 2. If the first two bytes of the CBOR byte string are equal to: 'FF D8', the bytestring contains a JPEG encoded image.
