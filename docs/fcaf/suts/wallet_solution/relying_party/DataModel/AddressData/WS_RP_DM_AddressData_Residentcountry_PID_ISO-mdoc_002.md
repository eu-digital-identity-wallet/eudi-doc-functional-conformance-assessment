## Profile applicability
The EUDI wallet contains a Credential in ISO-mdoc format with DocType = "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1". Data element `resident_country` is present in the mdoc data.

## Preconditions
A. A device retrieval mdoc request was sent to the EUDI wallet, to retrieve the document with DocType = "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1". 
B. All mandatory data elements within namespace "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1" and all data elements indicated as present in the ICS were requested. 
C. The device retrieval mdoc response was retrieved. 
D. The presence of data element `resident_country` in the device retrieval mdoc response was verified.

## Test Scenario
1. Verify the major type encoded on the first byte of the CBOR data item.
2. Verify the encoding of the data item value.

## Expected results
1. The major type value is equal to 3. 
2. All bytes in the data item value are UTF-8 encoded characters.
