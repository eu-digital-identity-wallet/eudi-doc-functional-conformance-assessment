# WS_AP_SM_DeviceBinding_010b

## Objective

Verify that the Wallet uses an acceptable algorithm for signing the proof with Key Attestation in the Credential Request to the Credential Endpoint of a Credential Issuer, when the `jwt` Proof Type is used.

## Profile applicability

Wallet uses the `jwt` proof type to convey a key attestation in Credential Requests.

## Technology

Credential with Key Binding.

## Preconditions

1. Wallet is set to 'default_configuration_1'
2. Wallet started engagement with Credential Issuer.
3. Wallet successfully authenticated to the (Authorization Server of the) Credential Issuer.
4. Wallet successfully obtained an Access Token from the Token Endpoint of the (Authorization Server of the) Credential Issuer.
5. Wallet send a syntactically correct Credential Request to the Credential Endpoint of the Credential Issuer.
6. Wallet send a syntactically correct `proofs` parameter in the Credential Request.
7. Wallet send a correctly serialized JWT as proof with Key Attestation in the Credential Request.

## Test Scenario

1. Verify the signature algorithm (`alg` in protected header) used for signing the proof with Key Attestation.

## Expected results

1. The signature algorithm in `alg`:
    1. is on the list of acceptable algorithms [ECCG ACM], and
	2. is one of `ES256`, `ES384`, or `ES512`.

## Comment

TODO consider `proof_signing_alg_values_supported` as well!
