## Profile applicability

None

## Technology

Issuance via Redirects.

## Preconditions

1. Wallet is set to 'default_configuration_1'
2. Wallet started engagement with Credential Issuer.
3. Wallet successfully authenticated to the (Authorization Server of the) Credential Issuer.
4. The Wallet obtained an Access Token from a Token Response that did not return `credential_identifiers`.
5. Wallet send a correctly formatted HTTP Request to the Credential Endpoint.

## Test Scenario

1. Verify the presence of parameters in the HTTP Request send to the Credential Endpoint.

## Expected results

1. The HTTP Request contains the following parameters:
    1. `credential_identifier` is absent
    2. `credential_configuration_id` is present
    3. `proofs` is present
    4. (optionally) `credential_response_encryption` can be present

## Comments

- HAIP requires the `scope` Authorization parameter; under OpenID4VCI 8.2, the Credential Request uses `credential_configuration_id` only when the Token Response did not return `credential_identifiers`.
