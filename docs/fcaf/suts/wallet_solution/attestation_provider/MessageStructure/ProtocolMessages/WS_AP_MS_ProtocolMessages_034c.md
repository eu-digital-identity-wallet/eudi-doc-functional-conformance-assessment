## Profile applicability
Wallet that uses JAR during PAR for the Authorization Request to the Authorization Server on Credential Issuance.

## Technology
Issuance via Redirects.

## Preconditions
A. End-user is engaging with a Credential Issuer using a User-agent.
B. Wallet started engagement with Credential Issuer.
C. Wallet successfully obtained Credential Issuer Metadata.
D. The Wallet sends an HTTP POST Request to the selected Authorization Server's PAR endpoint.
E. The HTTP POST Request to the selected Authorization Server's PAR endpoint contains a `request` parameter.

## Test Scenario
1. Verify the `request` parameter in the received HTTP Request.

## Expected results

* Note: validation of the signed JWT itself as Authorization Request, is done in other test cases.
