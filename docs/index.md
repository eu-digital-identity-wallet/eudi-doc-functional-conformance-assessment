# Overview

## Functional Conformance Assessment Framework (FCAF)

This repository documents the **Functional Conformance Assessment Framework (FCAF)** for the
[European Digital Identity Wallet](https://eudi.dev/) ecosystem.

The FCAF provides a harmonised approach for defining and applying **functional conformance test artefacts**
to support wallet certification and to improve interoperability across Member States.

> ⚠️ **Status:** This documentation is under active development.
> Structure, scope, and timelines are subject to change.

- High-level introduction to functional conformance testing and its scope
- Description of the FCAF artefacts (e.g., structure, test specifications, test books, data definitions, traceability, guidance)
- The initial System Under Test (SUT): **Wallet Solution**
- Templates used to create consistent test artefacts across components
- A tentative roadmap

## Versioning & changelog

[SemVer](http://semver.org/) is used for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-functional-conformance-assessment-framework/tags). Also see [CHANGELOG.md](#changelog-source) for a summary of externally visible changes between releases.

Version numbers reflect **artefact maturity**, not immutability of the legal framework:

- **v0.0.x** — Bootstrap phase (structure, orientation, initial content)
- **v0.1.0** — MVP version, enabling CAB preparation and pilot assessments
- **v1.0.0** — First version meeting all mandatory functional requirements under the applicable
  Implementing Regulations, suitable for regulatory use

For versions with major version `0`, the framework should be considered under active development;
**minor and patch releases may introduce breaking changes** as structure, scope, and interpretations
are refined. Stability expectations apply from version `1.0.0` onwards.
